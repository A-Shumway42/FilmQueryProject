# FilmQueryProject

## Description
This is my fifth project while at Skill Distillery. For this project, the goal was to design a Film Query Application. A user will be presented with a simple three option menu. The options are to search for a film by its film Id, search for a film by a specific keyword which scans every film title or description, and the last option is to exit the program. If the user found a film in the database, the film's title, release year, rating, description, language and list of actors are displayed for that specific film.

## What I Learned
I learned how combining other languages into Java can produce excellent results. Using the command line, with SQL queries to search through a database and pull the exact information we want out was really exciting to learn. I believe this project helped my logical thinking skills improve. Manipulating tables and sub-tables to get what I needed helped me understand data structure.

## Technologies Used
Git, Eclipse, Java, SQL, Maven.
